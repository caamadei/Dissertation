As discussed in the main text, the GO solution was prepared using a modified Hummers' method\cite{Hummers1958} with additional pre-processing of the graphite powder.\cite{Kovtyukhova1999} The preoxidation of the graphite powder (5 g; d $= 45\ \mu$m) was completed using sulfuric acid (30 mL; 97\% H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$), phosphorus pentoxide (4.2 g; P$_{2}$O$_{5}$), and potassium persulfate (4.2 g; K$_{2}$S$_{2}$O$_{8}$) in a water bath at 75$^{\circ}$C for 4.5 h. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature and diluted with 700 mL of deionized water (DI) and vacuum filtered through a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) membrane (pore size $5\ \mu$m). After pre-oxidation, the graphite was subjected to a modified Hummers' method.\cite{Hummers1958} During this process, the pre-oxidized material was suspended in H$_{2}$SO$_{4}$ (150 mL; 97\%) in an ice bath for 20 min. Potassium permanganate was slowly added (15 g; KMnO$_{4}$) and the mixture was heated to 35 $^{\circ}$C for 2 h. Hummers' method was completed by adding 250 mL of DI water and heating the mixture to 70$^{\circ}$C for an additional 2 h. After quenching the reaction with hydrogen peroxide (30 mL; H$_{2}$O$_{2}$) and DI water (750 mL), it was allowed to cool to room temperature. In order to quench the unreacted reagent and clean the solution, the product was then filtered through a 300 $\mu$m testing sieve, then through glass fiber and centrifuged for 2 h at 5000 RPM (\textit{Sorvall RC-5C} plus). The supernatant was then washed with hydrochloric acid (400 mL, 10\% HCl). The sieving, centrifugation, and washing process was then repeated using DI (two times) and ethanol (EtOH, two times). The final solution was then dispersed in 300 mL of EtOH at a concentration of $\approx 0.1$ wt\%.

%\section{Graphene Oxide Nanoscroll Formation}

Various stages of the formation of three different GONS are displayed in Fig.~\ref{figS1_AppB}. In Fig.~\ref{figS1_AppB}a a large portion of the GO sheet has not scrolled, indicating an early stage of GONS formation. Fig.~\ref{figS1_AppB}b is GONS in a more advanced state, in which the majority of the GO sheet is scrolled around the main structure. Fig.~\ref{figS1_AppB}c is near the end of the formation of GONS as characterized by an almost complete scrolling of the GO.

The different geometries depicted in Fig.~3 in the main text can originate from the same GO flake. Fig.~\ref{figSa_AppB} represents a scrolled GO flake where it is possible to recognize two T-GONS and one C-GONS.

Fig.~\ref{figSa_AppB} demonstrates the hollow nature of the GONS acquired \textit{via} transmission electron microscopy. Fig.~\ref{figSa_AppB}a presents GONS whose tail (right side) is not scrolled in accordance with the multi-layer structure. Fig.~\ref{figSa_AppB}b presents open-structure GONS, characteristic of an incomplete scrolling process.

Fig.~\ref{figS4_AppB} represent the statistical analysis of the GONS diameters for different geometries. Statistical data is based on a population of $10-15$ GONS for each geometry. Fitting with normal distributions shows that the diameter of the narrow tube-like GONS is $225 \pm 85$ nm ($\mathbb{R}^{2} = 0.9964$) while the diameter of the wide tube-like GONS is $1.802 \pm 0.273\ \mu$m ($\mathbb{R}^{2} = 0.99$). Also, the Gaussian fits show that the minimum diameters of the cone-like GONS are $193 \pm 1$ nm ($\mathbb{R}^{2} = 0.9999$) for the narrow cone and $0.948 \pm 0.317\ \mu$m ($\mathbb{R}^{2} = 0.8722$) for the wide cone, while the maximum diameters are $1.65 \pm 0.391\ \mu$m ($\mathbb{R}^{2} = 0.9668$) for the narrow cone and $1.84 \pm 0.331\ \mu$m ($\mathbb{R}^{2} = 0.9548$) for the wide cone.

Fig.~\ref{figS5_AppB} represents an AFM image of GONS. The cross-section line highlights its multilayered structure. On the left side of the image, it is possible to notice a GO flake not wrapped around the GONS characterized by a thickness of $\approx2$ nm. The GONS maximum thickness is $\approx12$ nm and it displays a noticeable wrinkle on the outer most layer.

Fig.~\ref{figS6_AppB} represents the C1s peak for the parent GO flake (Fig.~\ref{figS6_AppB}a), after 5 minutes of LF irradiation (Fig.~\ref{figS6_AppB}b), and 5 minutes of HF irradiation time (Fig.~\ref{figS6_AppB}c). The post-treatment XPS shows a reduction in the C-O peak from 65\% to $\approx25\%$, and increase in C-C/C=C from 30\% to $\approx60\%$ which is related to the cleavage of GO sheet at oxygen defects in the basal plane as explained in the main text.

%\subsection{Solution Volume Dependence}

\begin{figure}[htp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=6.5in]{FigSb_rev2.pdf}
  \caption{\textbf{Influence of the solution volume ($V$) on the evolution of $A_{\mathrm{GO}}$ and $L_{\mathrm{GONS}}$ as a function of the treatment time ($t$).}}
  \label{figSb_AppB}
\end{figure}

Since the volume of the GO solution used during HF and LF processing could affect the $A_{\mathrm{GO}}$ and $L_{\mathrm{GONS}}$, but this effect will be more pronounced in the highly destructive LF treatment method, and may alter the $A_{\mathrm{GO}}$ and $L_{\mathrm{GONS}}$ evolution kinetics presented in Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 in the main text. As Fig.~\ref{figSb_AppB} illustrates, reducing the volume of the solution used in the LF(10W) treatment leads to a faster reduction in $A_{\mathrm{GO}}$ ($A_{1} = 101.7\ \mu$m$^{2}$, $k_{\mathrm{GO}} = 0.538$, $A_{2} = 5.99\ \mu$m$^{2}$, $s_{1} = 0.50$, and $t_{\mathrm{crit}} = 7.1$ min) and $L_{\mathrm{GONS}}$ ($L_{2} = 5.1\  \mu$m, $s_{2} = 0.518$,  and $t_{\mathrm{crit}} \leq 5$ min), but the general kinetics are very similar to the ones observed for LF(100W) and are consistent with Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 in the main text.
