	graphene exhibits great potential for use in sensors{,} catalysts{,}
	electrodes{,} and in biological applications{,} etc. With further
	developments in the theoretical understanding and assembly techniques{,}
	graphene should enable great changes both in scientific research
	and practical industrial applications. By the look of development{,}
	it is of fundamental and practical significance to translate the
	novel physical and chemical properties of individual graphene nanosheets
	into the macroscale by the assembly of graphene building blocks into
	macroscopic architectures with structural specialities and functional
	novelties. The combined features of a 2D planar structure and abundant
	functional groups of graphene oxide (GO) should provide great possibilities
	for the assembly of GO nanosheets into macroscopic architectures
	with different macroscaled shapes through various assembly techniques
	under different bonding interactions. Moreover{,} macroscopic graphene
	frameworks can be used as ideal scaffolds for the incorporation of
	functional materials to offset the shortage of pure graphene in the
	specific desired functionality. The advantages of light weight{,}
	supra-flexibility{,} large surface area{,} tough mechanical strength{,}
	and high electrical conductivity guarantee graphene-based architectures
	wide application fields. This critical review mainly addresses recent
	advances in the design and fabrication of graphene-based macroscopic
	assemblies and architectures and their potential applications. Herein{,}
	we first provide overviews of the functional macroscopic graphene
	materials from three aspects{,} i.e.{,} 1D graphene fibers/ribbons{,}
	2D graphene films/papers{,} 3D network-structured graphene monoliths{,}
	and their composite counterparts with either polymers or nano-objects.
	Then{,} we present the promising potential applications of graphene-based
	macroscopic assemblies in the fields of electronic and optoelectronic
	devices{,} sensors{,} electrochemical energy devices{,} and in water
	treatment. Last{,} the personal conclusions and perspectives for
	this intriguing field are given.},

	crystals during the shock cooling process in liquid nitrogen to be
	the driving force. The other might be due to the uneven stress of
	the sheets inside or outside ice during the lyophilization. After
	reducing, graphene nanoscrolls (GNS) exhibited good structural stability,
	high specific surface area, and high specific capacitance. The capacitance
	properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic
	charge-discharge, and electrical impedance spectroscopy. A specific
	capacity of 156F/g for the GNS at the current density of 1.0 A/g
	was obtained comparing with the specific capacity of 108F/g for graphene
	sheets. Those results indicated that GNS-based rolling structure
	could be a kind of promising electrode material for supercapacitors

  abstract = {Mechanical stress can drive chemical reactions and is unique in that
	the reaction product can depend on both the magnitude and the direction
	of the applied force. Indeed, this directionality can drive chemical
	reactions impossible through conventional means. However, unlike
	heat- or pressure-driven reactions, mechanical stress is rarely applied
	isometrically, obscuring how mechanical inputs relate to the force
	applied to the bond. Here we report an atomic force microscope technique
	that can measure mechanically induced bond scission on graphene in
	real time with sensitivity to atomic-scale interactions. Quantitative
	measurements of the stress-driven reaction dynamics show that the
	reaction rate depends both on the bond being broken and on the tip
	material. Oxygen cleaves from graphene more readily than fluorine,
	which in turn cleaves more readily than hydrogen. The technique may
	be extended to study the mechanochemistry of any arbitrary combination
	of tip material, chemical group and substrate.},

	high pressure acting on ions inside graphene capillaries.},

	The exfoliation process shall be considered as a particular fragmentation
	process{,} where the 2D character of the exfoliated objects will
	influence significantly fragmentation dynamics as compared to standard
	materials. Here{,} we used automatized image processing of Atomic
	Force Microscopy (AFM) data to measure{,} one by one{,} the exact
	shape and size of thousands of nanosheets obtained by exfoliation
	of an important 2D-material{,} boron nitride{,} and used different
	statistical functions to model the asymmetric distribution of nanosheet
	sizes typically obtained. Being the resolution of AFM much larger
	than the average sheet size{,} analysis could be performed directly
	at the nanoscale and at the single sheet level. We find that the
	size distribution of the sheets at a given time follows a log-normal
	distribution{,} indicating that the exfoliation process has a {"}typical{"}
	scale length that changes with time and that exfoliation proceeds
	through the formation of a distribution of random cracks that follow
	Poisson statistics. The validity of this model implies that the size
	distribution does not depend on the different preparation methods
	used{,} but is a common feature in the exfoliation of this material
	and thus probably for other 2D materials.},

	a versatile material in this direction, its use is limited by the

	thermal annealing procedure, with no chemical treatments involved,
	to manipulate as-synthesized GO on a large scale to enhance sheet
	properties with the oxygen content preserved. Using experiments supported
	by atomistic calculations, we demonstrate that GO structures undergo
	a phase transformation into prominent oxidized and graphitic domains
	by temperature-driven oxygen diffusion. Consequently, as-synthesized
	GO that absorbs mainly in the ultraviolet region becomes strongly
	absorbing in the visible region, photoluminescence is blue shifted
	and electronic conductivity increases by up to four orders of magnitude.
	Our thermal processing method offers a suitable way to tune and enhance
	the properties of GO, which creates opportunities for various applications.},

	power law t-m. Yet the breakage mechanism is not well understood,
	and the experimentally reported power law exponent m ranges from
	approximately 0.2 to 0.5. Here we simulate the motion of CNTs around
	cavitating bubbles by coupling Brownian dynamics with the Rayleigh–Plesset
	equation. We observe that, during bubble growth, CNTs align tangentially
	to the bubble surface. Surprisingly, we find two dynamical regimes
	during the collapse: shorter CNTs align radially, longer ones buckle.
	We compute the phase diagram for CNT collapse dynamics as a function
	of CNT length, stiffness, and initial distance from the bubble nuclei
	and determine the transition from aligning to buckling. We conclude
	that, depending on their length, CNTs can break due to either buckling
	or stretching. These two mechanisms yield different power laws for
	the length decay (0.25 and 0.5, respectively), reconciling the apparent
	discrepancy in the experimental data.},

  abstract = {To progress from the laboratory to commercial applications, it will
	be necessary to develop industrially scalable methods to produce
	large quantities of defect-free graphene. Here we show that high-shear
	mixing of graphite in suitable stabilizing liquids results in large-scale
	exfoliation to give dispersions of graphene nanosheets. X-ray photoelectron
	spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy show the exfoliated flakes to
	be unoxidized and free of basal-plane defects. We have developed
	a simple model that shows exfoliation to occur once the local shear
	rate exceeds 104 sâˆ’1. By fully characterizing the scaling behaviour
	of the graphene production rate, we show that exfoliation can be
	achieved in liquid volumes from hundreds of millilitres up to hundreds
	of litres and beyond. The graphene produced by this method performs
	well in applications from composites to conductive coatings. This
	method can be applied to exfoliate BN, MoS2 and a range of other
	layered crystals.},

	concentration. The degree of disorder in the GNP structure is similar

	to remove any chemicals post-processing. Ink-jet printing onto heated
	quartz substrates produced films which reached electrical conductivities

	materials and provides an unusual route to known materials without
	bulk high temperatures{,} high pressures{,} or long reaction times.
	Several phenomena are responsible for sonochemistry and specifically
	the production or modification of nanomaterials during ultrasonic
	irradiation. The most notable effects are consequences of acoustic
	cavitation (the formation{,} growth{,} and implosive collapse of
	bubbles){,} and can be categorized as primary sonochemistry (gas-phase
	chemistry occurring inside collapsing bubbles){,} secondary sonochemistry
	(solution-phase chemistry occurring outside the bubbles){,} and physical
	modifications (caused by high-speed jets or shock waves derived from
	bubble collapse). This tutorial review provides examples of how the
	chemical and physical effects of high intensity ultrasound can be
	exploited for the preparation or modification of a wide range of

	structure{,} including flat{,} rippled{,} standing collapsed{,} folded{,}

	the Langmuir-Blodgett (L-B) technique. The MD simulations show that
	the GO becomes much softer than pristine graphene sheets due to the
	sp3-hybridization caused by oxygen containing functional groups and
	this is the reason why a series of distinct structures were observed.
	To demonstrate the fabrication of a transparent conductor{,} the

abstract = "We demonstrated that a thin-film composite (TFC) membrane with graphene oxide (GO) embedded in its polyamide (PA) layer exhibited high water permeability, anti-biofouling property, and chlorine resistance without loss of salt rejection. The GO fabricated by chemical exfoliation was fractionated for size control, and then the fractionated GO was dispersed in an aqueous solution of m-phenylenediamine (MPD) before interfacial polymerization. The water permeability and anti-biofouling property of the GO-embedded TFC (GO-TFC) membrane were enhanced by approximately 80\% and 98\% (based on the biovolume), respectively, and high salt rejection was retained even at 48,000ppmh chlorination. Compared with the TFC membrane, the enhanced performances of the GO-TFC membrane were attributed to the change of hydrophilicity, surface charge, surface roughness, and thickness of the PA layer through the incorporation of GO. Both the size and the concentration of GO were the key factors in improving the performance of the GO-TFC membrane."
